I'd like your help to build a simple demo app.

title: Simple Bank

Context:
- a customer can have multiple accounts
- an account may be shared by multiple customers

Stories
- a customer can create a new account, delete an existing account
- a customer can deposit, withdraw, view balance, transfer funds between self owned accounts
- a customer transfer funds to another customer

rules

```


### resposnse

The scope of the demo app, titled "Simple Bank," seems well-structured and provides a good foundation for basic banking functionalities. Here are a few suggestions to enhance and refine the scope of the demo:

### Suggestions for Enhancement

1. **User Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement a user authentication system to ensure only registered customers can access and manage accounts.
   - Use roles to differentiate between customers and administrators (if needed).

2. **Audit and Transaction History:**
   - Maintain a transaction history for each account, allowing customers to view past transactions.
   - Implement auditing features for tracking account creation, deletion, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.

3. **Notifications:**
   - Send notifications (email/SMS) to customers for important actions like account creation, large transactions, and low balance alerts.

4. **Error Handling and Validation:**
   - Ensure robust error handling and validation for all operations (e.g., preventing overdrafts, validating input data).

5. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for performing all operations (account management, transactions, balance inquiries).
   - Consider using responsive design principles to ensure the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

6. **Security:**
   - Implement security best practices, such as encryption for sensitive data, secure password storage, and protection against common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

7. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - Provide customers with basic reporting features, such as generating account statements and visualizing spending patterns.

8. **Support for Different Currencies:**
   - If relevant, support multiple currencies and handle currency conversions for international transfers.

### Updated Stories with Suggested Enhancements

- A customer can register, log in, and manage their profile.
- A customer can create a new account, delete an existing account.
- A customer can deposit, withdraw, view balance, and transfer funds between self-owned accounts.
- A customer can transfer funds to another customer.
- A customer can view transaction history for each account.
- A customer can receive notifications for significant transactions and low balances.
- An administrator can view and audit all customer accounts and transactions.

### Rules

- The balance of an account cannot go below 0.00.
- All transactions must be logged with a timestamp and transaction ID.
- Sensitive customer information must be securely stored and transmitted.

### Conclusion

These suggestions aim to improve the functionality, usability, and security of the Simple Bank demo app, making it a more comprehensive and realistic representation of a banking system.

If you have any additional feedback or adjustments, please let me know.

## Design and Architecture Planning

### Design and Architecture Planning

#### Session 2: Design Review
